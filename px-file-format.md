# PX file format 2013
## Readers guide
### What this instruction covers
This manual describes how a PC-Axis PX file is constructed.
The manual is intended for people that wants to get a introduction of how to
use and to extend the Core part of the PC-Axis SDK.
The reader are not required have any type of PC-Axis experience to
understand the content but it helps. 

### How this guide is organized
The document is divided into two part. The first part defines how the PX file
structure works. The second part defined all keywords used in the PC-Axis
File Format.

### Related documents
Earlier versions of the PC-Axis file format.

## Getting started
We must first try to explain the basic structure of the PX-file. PX-files
consist of keywords that describes the contents or the data cube. Some
keywords are mandatory while some are optional.
Some keywords have an language option and some keywords have a sub key
and there is always at least one value specified for a keyword.
Some basic rules for how keywords are written
- The keyword is mandatory.
- Language is optional.
- Language is always written within square brackets.
- Language is always written immediately after the keyword.
- The sub key is optional.
- The sub key is always written within parentheses.
- The sub key is written is written after language if present otherwise it is written after the keyword.
- Value(s) are mandatory.
- Value(s) are always written after the equal sign.
- If there are multiple values each value is written within quotation marks and are separated by a comma sign.
- If there is only one value then it can be written without any quotation marks.
- Values(s) are delimited with quotation marks which means that a value itself cannot contain a quotation mark.
- The end of values (and the beginning of a new keyword) is always
marked with a semicolon.
- Longer texts are divided into several records (except for value text orvariable names which must in one line when in parentheses after a keyword).

```
KEYWORD[LANGUAGE](SUB-KEY)="VALUE_1","VALUE_2", …;
KEYWORD[LANGUAGE](SUB-KEY)=VALUE_1;
KEYWORD[LANGUAGE]="VALUE_1","VALUE_2", …;
KEYWORD (SUB-KEY)="VALUE_1","VALUE_2", …;
KEYWORD[LANGUAGE]=VALUE_1;
KEYWORD(SUB-KEY)=VALUE_1;
```
The file itself is divided into two parts one metadata part and the data part.
The data part starts after the keyword `DATA`.
If the keyword `CHARSET` is missing it means that all texts are in DOS text
format, so that the same files can be used both in the DOS and the Windows
version of PC-Axis.
Starting with version 2005 it is possible to have more than one language in a
PX file. The second language is repeated for all necessary keywords.
`CONTENTS="Population";`, `CONTENTS[sv]=”Befolkning”;` etc. Which
languages are available are given in the keyword `LANGUAGES`.

### Mandatory keywords
These keywords are compulsory. The text (the contents belonging to the key
word) should be written on the same line as the keyword or on a line of its
own, always within quotation marks.
#### CONTENTS
**Type:** Text
**Length:** 256 characters
**Multiline:** No

Information about the contents, which makes up the first part of a title
created when retrieving tables from PC-Axis. The text must not exceed 256
characters (before 2002 only 100 chars).

#### DATA
**Type:** integer/text
**Length:** N/A
**Multiline:** Yes

The keyword `DATA` must be placed at the end of the file, followed by all the
data cells or if `KEYS` are used the variable values and all data cells that differ
from `0`.

##### File without `KEYS`
After the key word follows all data cells that belong to the table.
In most cases the cells are written with one record per line in the table. The
number of records will thus be determined by the number of values in the
stub. The length of the records depends upon the number of values in the
heading, and also upon the size of figures.
Table cells that contain a dash, one, two, three, four, five or six dots should
be within quotation marks.
For data without keys it is possible to write all cells in just one record,
terminated by a semicolon.
PC-Axis accepts the delimiters comma, space, semicolon, tabulator. The
different delimiters are synonyms and can be mixed in the file.
Recommended delimiter is space.

##### Files with `KEYS`
For every variable in the stub is indicated the value for the variable within
quotation marks, comma separated, followed by all data cells for that row
(no quotation marks, space separated).

Whether the text from `VALUES` or from `CODES` are used for a variable is
indicated by the keyword `KEYS(”var”)=CODES` or
`KEYS(”var”)=VALUES`. It is possible to use `VALUES` from one variable
and `CODES` for another in the same file.
Rows that only contain 0 (zeros) are excluded from the file
One - six dots
Data that is missing is stored as one, two, three, four, five or six dots.
It is not possible to get a dot or two dots by excluding a value. Thus, you
cannot write `1,,2,3` in order to get `1,".",3,4`
For PC-Axis version prior to 2005 a dash is presented as 0 and saved as 0.
Thus, you cannot afterwards find out if the original value was - or 0. Starting
with 2005 PC-Axis keeps track on which cells are – and the keyword
`DATASYMBOLNIL` can be used to show something else in the table.
How the dots are shown on screen is determined by the keywords
`DATASYMBOL1`, etc. If these keywords are missing the presentation is
taken from PC-Axis language files.

##### Number of decimals when a file is saved
The keyword `DECIMALS` determines the number of decimals to be saved. If
the file also contains the key word `PRECISION`, PC-AXIS saves as many
decimals as corresponds to the largest number specified by `DECIMALS` or
`PRECISION`. All cells are stored with the same number of decimals.

#### DECIMALS
**Type:** integer [0, 15]
**Length:** Lines of 256 characters
**Multiline:** No

The number of decimals in the table cells. 0 - 15. (0-6 if `SHOWDECIMALS`
is not included). Indicates how many decimals will be saved in the PC-Axis
file. Written without quotation marks. Compare `SHOWDECIMALS`.

#### DESCRIPTION
**Type:** text
**Length:** N/A
**Multiline:** Yes

If a file contains `DESCRIPTION`, when fetching from a disk, this text is used
to show the contents of the disk. C.f. `TITLE`.
If the user wants to save a file in PC-AXIS and writes a text that describes
the file, this text will be saved as `DESCRIPTION`. The text will be used to
show the contents of tables in the SUBJECT AREA. The text is not
presented as a note nor in any other way when the table is presented on the
screen unless the keyword `DESCRIPTIONDEFAULT` is used. In this case
the description is shown instead of the title.

#### HEADING
***Type:*** text
***Length:*** 256 character per value
***Multiline:*** Yes

At least one of the keywords `STUB` or `HEADING` must be included. Usually
both are included, as you choose one or several variables for the stub and the
heading, respectively. The keywords are followed by a list with the chosen
variables. The variables are within quotation marks and separated by
commas. If the list with the variables has to be divided up into several lines,
this should be done after a comma and not within the variable name.

#### MATRIX
**Type:** text
**Length:** 20
**Multiline:** No

The name of the matrix. Is suggested as file name when the file is fetched.
(new length 2008).

#### STUB
**Type:** text
**Length:** 256 characters per value
**Multiline:** Yes

At least one of the keywords `STUB` or `HEADING` must be included. Usually
both are included, as you choose one or several variables for the stub and the
heading, respectively. The keywords are followed by a list with the chosen
variables. The variables are within quotation marks and separated by
commas. If the list with the variables has to be divided up into several lines,
this should be done after a comma and not within the variable name.

#### SUBJECT-AREA
**Type:** text
**Length:** 256 characters
**Multiline:** No

The name of the subject area in plain text, as shown in the menu "Select
subject area". The text must not exceed 256 characters (new length in 2008).

#### SUBJECT-CODE
**Type:** text
**Length:** 20 characters
**Multiline:** No

Subject area code. It is used to create files with tables available in PC-Axis.
The text must not exceed 20 characters (new length 2008).

#### TITLE
**Type:** text
**Length:** Lines of 256 characters
**Multiline:** Yes

The title of the table, reflecting its contents and variables. Is not needed if the
file contains `DESCRIPTION`, in that case the text belonging to description is
used. How the heading of a table will look depends on which variables the
user chooses; the heading thus created will then be saved as `TITLE`.
(Compare also `DESCRIPTIONDEFAULT`)
If the file contains `DESCRIPTION` the text for this key word will be used.

#### UNITS
**Type:** text
**Length:** 256 characters
**Multiline:** No

Unit text, e.g. ton, index. The text must not exceed 256 characters (new
length 2008). Compare `UNITS` for `CONTVARIABLE`.
When there is a `CONTVARIABLE` the keyword `UNITS` takes an index and
is repeated for every value for the contents variable. `UNITS("value")="tons"`.

#### VALUES
**Type:** text
**Length:** 256 characters per value
**Multiline:** Yes

The keyword `VALUES` occurs once for each variable in the table, and is
followed by the variable name in parentheses, within quotation marks. The
values will be in the same order as in the stub and heading, respectively.
They are within quotation marks and separated by commas. Each value name

`CODES` keyword. Which observation it refers to is given by the key which is
written within parenthesis after the keyword and before the equal sign.
The format of the key is one value code for each variable in the order
indicated by `STUB` and `HEADING` starting with the variables in the `STUB`.
If the attribute key is missing then this will indicate the default values for the
attributes for all measures that do not have any `ATTRIBUTES` specified.
This is also referred to as the default attributes. The default attributes should

demands it. In PC-AXIS it is shown if the user presses F7. The footnote may
either refer to the entire table or to a table variable. In the latter case the key
word must be followed by the variable name in parentheses.

#### NOTEX
**Type:** text
**Length:** Lines of 256 characters
**Multiline:** Yes

Contains a note which is always shown in the statistical databases. In PCAXIS the note is shown automatically, before the table is presented on the

#### OFFICIAL-STATISTICS
**Type:** {YES, NO}
**Length:** N/A
**Multiline:** No

Indicates if the data table is included in the official statistics of the
organization.

#### PARTITIONED
**Type:** complex text
**Length:** N/A
**Multiline:** Yes
This is used to partition a variable into levels, for instance
```
PARTITIONED("region")="municipality",1,4;
PARTITIONED("region")="subarea",5;
```
states that the first four positions for the regional values contain the
municipality code, and that the subarea code starts in position 5. Thus the
values for the variable region after the key word `VALUES` must be written in
code, not plain text. Max 3 levels can be used, each gives start position and
length except for the last level where length is implied as rest of the code.

#### PRECISION
**Type:** integer
**Length:** N/A
**Multiline:** No
Can occur for single values. Determines that the value shall be presented
with a number of decimals that differs from the keyword
`SHOWDECIMALS`. Is to be written as
`PRECISION("variable name","value name")=n` where n is a figure between `1`
and `6`. The number of decimals for precision must be higher than the number
of decimals for `SHOWDECIMALS` to have any effect.

#### PRESTEXT
**Type:** integer
**Length:** N/A
**Multiline:** No

From PX file format version 2010 and later the definition of PRESTEXT is
changed the prior versions defines it as:
States if texts or codes are shown for the keyword `VALUES`. Normally a file
is created so that texts are found after the keyword `VALUES` and codes after
the keyword `CODES`. This is equivalent to `PRESTEXT("variable name")=1;`
which is the default. If a user changes presentation from texts to codes and
saves the file the value codes will be saved after the keyword `VALUES` and
value texts after the keyword `CODES`. In this case the keyword `PRESTEXT` is
written as `PRESTEXT("variable name")=0`. This enables PC-Axis to know if
it is necessary to switch to codes if aggregation is selected. The user can also
decide to show both codes and texts for a value and in this case the keyword
is saved as `PRESTEXT("variable name")=2` or `PRESTEXT("variable name")=3`. `PRESTEXT` becomes 2 if it originally was 1 and 3 if it originally
was 0.
In the new definition the `PRESTEXT` is that it is an integer value between 0-
3 that describes how the value should be presented in a user interface. The
values text should always be defined by the `VALUES` keyword and the
codes should always be defined by the `CODES` keyword.
- 0 - Only the value code should be displayed.
- 1 - Only the value text should be displayed.
- 2 - Both code and value should be displayed and the order should be
the code and then the value text.
- 3 - Both code and value should be displayed and the order should be
the value text then the value code.

**Example**
```
VALUES("region")="Albania","Austria",…
…
CODES("region")="AL","AT",…
…
PRESTEXT("region")=2
Since the PRESTEXT is set to 2 the values would be presented as
AL Albania
AT Austria
…
```

#### PX-SERVER

#### ROUNDING
**Type:** integer
**Length:** 0-1
**Multiline:** Yes

If rounding is missing then rounding will be done in accordance with
information in the pcax2000.ini file. If the keyword is missing then the
decimal rule in pcax2000.ini is used.
- Rounding = `0` means that .5 is rounded up if the previous figure is odd, 1.5
becomes 2.
- Rounding = `1` means that .5 is always rounded up. 0.5 becomes 1 and 1.5
becomes 2.

#### SEASADJ

New keyword in version 1.5 to enable the use of time series. After the
keyword is the name of the time variable given, e.g. `TIMEVAL(”time”)`.
`TLIST` gives information on timescale and timeperiods. The time periods
must be consecutive.
If the table contains the time periods `1994`, `1995`, `1996` `TIMEVAL` can be
written in this way:
```
TIMEVAL(”time”)=TLIST(A1, ”1994”-”1996”);
```
or
```
TIMEVAL(”time”)=TLIST(A1), ”1994”, ”1995”,"1996”;
```
The following formats are used:
- `A1` for annual statistics written as `CCYY` (`C` for century, `Y` for year)
- `H1` for halfyear in format `CCYYH`, where `H` is 1 or 2
- `Q1` for quarterly data written `CCYYQ`, where `Q` is 1 - 4.
- `M1` for monthly statistics written `CCYYMM`
- `W1` for weekly data written `CCYYWW`

`TIMEVAL` is used in PC-AXIS version 1.7 when converting to Aremos and
Gesmes/Ecoser format. It is also used for start and stop time in list of
contents in HTML-format.
The variable time can be used both after the keyword `VALUES` and after
`TIMEVAL`. If both exist `TIMEVAL` must be placed after `VALUES`. If only
`TIMEVAL` exists `VALUES` for time are created as follows:
Time scale time periods shown as
```
